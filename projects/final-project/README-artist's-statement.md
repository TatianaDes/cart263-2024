# Artist's Statement:

Hard to Move On is a program about the five stages of grief in a very abstract way to express it in words as well as actions. There are five stages, the first being the stage that the main character, the sheep, starts in which is denial. Then the player can choose to go to the bottom, top, left or right from the initial stage to experience the grieving stages in their own abstract way. While the acceptance stage is the end of the game before it starts over, I feel like even if the player chooses to go to the right first, in a way it symbolizes how everyone experiences grieving differently. The goal in this program is to experience each stage and grow a little bit more every time until the acceptance stage truly is where the moving on begins. Each stage has a small statement describing the feelings that occur in the stage; these can be acquired by certain actions the player must do. For the technical aspect, I am hoping the actions are different from my first big program, since I do not want them to be too similar. But with the help of the Phaser 3 examples and guidance from my professor and TA, I am hoping that the ways in which the player can get the statements can be interesting and complex in its own way. Artistically, I enjoy making the sprites to be physical objects or creatures but they all symbolize their own meaning such as the sheep symbolizing innocence and trust and the coyote symbolizing cunningness. All elements in my program have a deeper meaning than what they truly are. I want my program to be different from my first program but still have the same tones to stick by my way of programming, which is simple but thoughtful.
