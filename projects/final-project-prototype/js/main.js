/**
Hard to Move On Prototype
Tatiana DÃ©sormeaux

A program using Phaser 3 code to help create a story about trying to move on from someone but recognizing the difficulty of it. It is about patience and effort that takes someone to be able to move forward in the first place even though the idea of going back feels so much easier but comes with so many more complications.
